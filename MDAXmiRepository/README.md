MDAXmiRepository
================
MDAXmiRepository is the XMI 1.2/UML 1.4 repository for the MDA Generator Framework.

Reads XMI files (written by ArgoUML for example) and makes the contained model
available as Java objects for further processing. Retains the structure of the
XMI 1.2/UML 1.4 meta model. The UML meta model is a bit inconvenient for code
generation. Therefore the MDAGenerator transforms these models into MDARepository
model which are more convenient to process in generator templates.

See the doc folder for further documentation.
