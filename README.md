MDAGenerator
============

Description
-----------
The MDA Generator Framework is the first incarnation of an UML based code
generator framework based on the Soulspace Template Engine.

The MDAGenerator repository now contains the modules (eclipse projects)
 * MDAXmiRepository
 * MDARepository
 * MDAGenerator
 * MDATemplateLibrary
 * MDADomainMetaModel

The modules can be built either with Baumeister or GlobalBuild at the
moment.

Documentation
-------------
You can find the generator usage documentation in the doc directory of the
MDAGenerator module. The documentation of the template language can be
found in directory TemplateEngine/doc in the TemplateEngine repository.

Notes
-----
 * The MDAGenerator is not in active development anymore. It has been
   released here merely for historical reasons. Please use the MDDGenerator
   now.
 * The preexisting single module repositories have now been merged into one
   MDAGenerator repository.
